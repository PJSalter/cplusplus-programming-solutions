# C++ Number Pattern Challenge

## Introduction

The C++ Number Pattern Challenge involves implementing a recursive function called `PrintNumPattern()` to generate a specific number pattern. Given a positive integer as input, along with another positive integer, the function subtracts the second integer continually until a negative value is reached. Then, it adds the second integer continually until the first integer is reached again. The lab requirements specify not ending the output with a newline.

## How to Use

Follow these steps to use the provided C++ solution for the "Number Pattern" challenge:

1. Compile the Code:

- Add the C++ code provided into your C++ development environment.
- Compile the code using your preferred C++ compiler.

2. Run the Program:

- Execute the compiled program.

3. Input Values:

- The program will prompt you to enter two positive integers: `num1` and `num2`.

4. Generate Pattern:

- The program will generate the number pattern based on your input and print it to the console.

5. Pattern Output:

- The generated number pattern will be displayed as a sequence of integers, separated by spaces, without ending with a newline.
